# Director's Proposal Contract

Use this contract for Phase A. Present a readable production proposal and stop for confirmation before writing model prompts. Refer to `references/style-catalog.md` for style specifications.

## Rewrite the source

Create one natural English narration of 130–150 words for approximately 55–65 seconds of speech.

- Preserve the source's core claim, names, numbers, and factual meaning.
- Strengthen a weak opening with an immediate hook.
- Remove repetition and secondary branches from long sources.
- Expand short sources with a relevant example, progression, reframe, or callback.
- Prefer clear spoken English to literal translation.
- Simplify wording before increasing speaking speed.
- Do not invent research, statistics, quotations, product claims, or factual details.

Use the user's language for planning explanations. Keep the voiceover in English and give a reference translation in the user's language.

## Header contract

Present these items in order:

1. English title and reference-language title
2. Core message and opening hook
3. Chosen aspect ratio and visual style/theme (Style 1 Classic Light/Dark, Style 2A Modern Studio Tech, or Style 2B Cinematic Story)
4. Narrator identity, speaking pace, English word count, and estimated duration
5. Up to three saturated accent colors (for Style 1) or visual palette/environment mood (for Style 2), named in ordinary language, and what each represents
6. BGM direction, emotional turn, tone, and narrative arc

Default the narrator only after required setup is complete: a bright, energetic adult female voice (or warm young adult American male voice) speaking natural American English. Infer tone and palette from the source when the user did not specify them.

## Narrative patterns

Choose the pattern that fits the source:

- Motivational: strong hook → recognition → escalation → reframe → action → payoff and CTA
- Educational: surprising hook → setup → mechanism → consequence → practical meaning → takeaway
- Commercial: pain point → consequence → product reveal → mechanism → proof or use case → benefit and CTA

## Storyboard contract

Produce six rows of approximately 4, 6, 8, or 10 seconds each, based on narrative function:

| Time | Narrative purpose | Stick-figure scene | Motion, camera, and transition | English VO | Reference translation | BGM / SFX |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Give each row a different narrative job. Allocate approximately 18–25 English words per row while keeping sentence boundaries natural.

## Visual-density recipe

Build every row from beats timed to the chosen clip length:

- `4s`: `[0–4s]` (single beat, main action)
- `6s`: `[0–3s]` and `[3–6s]` (two beats: initial setup and follow-up)
- `8s`: `[0–3s]`, `[3–6s]`, `[6–8s]` (three beats: setup, development, stabilise)
- `10s`: `[0–3s]`, `[3–7s]`, `[7–10s]` (three beats: setup, build‑up, conclusion)

Use at least four relevant devices per row:

- expressive stick-figure action (running, jumping, touching glass, drawing lines)
- environmental transformation
- concrete visual metaphor
- diagram, arrow, or icon-only symbol
- particles, energy, fluid, explosion, or light
- camera push, pull, pan, orbit, shake, or tracking move
- foreground wipe or object crossing the lens
- match cut, shape morph, or motion-matched transition
- interaction with another figure or oversized object

Require a perceptible visual change every two to three seconds within each clip's time frame. Make every effect clarify or intensify the spoken idea; omit unrelated spectacle. Avoid abstract liquid morphing.

## Palette and text

Keep the background and stick figure monochrome according to the selected theme (for Style 1), or use high-key studio grid / cinematic lighting (for Style 2). Use no more than three saturated accent colors across the video. Assign semantic meaning such as anxiety, danger, energy, discovery, or success.

Name colors only with ordinary descriptive language. Do not use hexadecimal, RGB, HSL, Pantone, or other technical color notation anywhere in the proposal or production prompts.

Default the generated video to no visible words, letters, numbers, captions, subtitles, interface copy, or technical annotations. Make message bubbles, content cards, meters, clocks, and notifications icon-only. After the storyboard, optionally list concise two-to-five-word English overlays for post-production, including their target clips and safe placement; never carry those overlays into the video-generation prompts.

## Composition by aspect ratio

- `16:9`: use left-center-right staging, lateral tracking, horizontal match cuts, and deliberate negative space. Reserve clean space for optional post-production overlays when useful.
- `9:16`: use foreground/background depth, vertical reveals, stacked motion, foreground passes, and interface-safe overlay space.
- `1:1`: keep action compact and center-weighted. Use short travel paths and avoid crucial events at extreme edges.

Changing ratio requires new staging, camera paths, transition geometry, and overlay-safe negative space. Changing theme or style requires updated color balance and contrast checks.

## Continuity

End each row with a visible interface that the next row inherits: a pose, moving object, filled frame, travel direction, shape, or camera motion. Name both sides of every connection in the proposal.

## Confirmation ending

End Phase A by asking the user to:

- approve the current proposal and generate the six Omni Flash prompts;
- revise a named scene or narration passage; or
- change a global setting such as aspect ratio, style, theme, palette, voice, or tone.

Do not include final model prompts. A global change invalidates approval and requires a revised Phase A.

## Phase A checks

- Source, aspect ratio, and style/theme are known.
- English narration is 130–150 words and approximately 55–65 seconds.
- Exactly six storyboard rows have distinct narrative purposes.
- Each row has beats based on clip length (4s: 1 beat; 6s → 2 beats; 8s → 3 beats; 10s → 3 beats), at least four visual devices, audio, and a transition.
- Visual change occurs approximately every two to three seconds within each clip's time frame.
- No more than three saturated accent colors are used (for Style 1) or clean palette rules followed (for Style 2).
- No technical color notation is present.
- Any proposed text is clearly separated as a post-production overlay and absent from generated scenes.
- Every adjacent pair has a named continuity connection.
- The ending returns to the central message.
- No unsupported factual detail was added.
